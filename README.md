# chopsticksAI
This is a project to create a computerized chopsticks player

For the rules of the game, refer to rules.txt

choplib.py contains the functions that make the game work. If enough people request it, I am ready to post the logic behind the code

A simple text-based interface is given in chop.py. Feel free to use your own interfaces.

Also, if you want sample games, use chop_rand.py.

Please suggest changes and improvements if you find any.

Thank you and enjoy!
